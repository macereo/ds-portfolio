  Hello there, and welcome to my Digital Portfolio! I'm a Data Scientist and 15-year Army Veteran ü´° with a passion for getting it right, doing good, and leaving a positive impact. 

  I began my tech journey as a Network Specialist (in the Army that's kind of a hybrid network engineer/admin/IT helpdesk), providing network communications and network connectivity at a regional scale and helping folks troubleshoot issues (usually turning things on and off, am I right?üëÄ). Although I intended to pursue higher education after high school, I struggled to find a subject that truly captured my interest--until 8 years later when my partner took a tour where some folks were using GIS. She came home that day and told me all about how data was being used in that office, and the rest is history--I was hooked.  

  I approach everything with a growth mindset, I'm results-oriented (thanks, Army!), and I have a work-ethic that's difficult to match. I carefully analyze (and let's be honest, I sometimes over-analyze üòÖ) obstacles, and love collaborating and brainstorming with others, but I'm equally confident taking initiative and working independently (just give me some headphones üéß). 

  When I don't have numbers swirling about my head, you can find me adventuring üó∫ with my partner, daughter, and two pups üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëßüêï‚Äçü¶∫ü¶Æ. I also love rugby üèâ, reading üìö, video games üéÆ, and throwing down weights at the gym üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 

  I'm just getting started with my official Digital Portfolio. It's a work in progress as I transition from the Army. Stay tuned and check back for more projects!
