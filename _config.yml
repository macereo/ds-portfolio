  Hello there, and welcome to my Digital Portfolio! I'm a Data Scientist and 15-year Army Veteran 🫡 with a passion for getting it right, doing good, and leaving a positive impact. 

  I began my tech journey as a Network Specialist (in the Army that's kind of a hybrid network engineer/admin/IT helpdesk), providing network communications and network connectivity at a regional scale and helping folks troubleshoot issues (usually turning things on and off, am I right?👀). Although I intended to pursue higher education after high school, I struggled to find a subject that truly captured my interest--until 8 years later when my partner took a tour where some folks were using GIS. She came home that day and told me all about how data was being used in that office, and the rest is history--I was hooked.  

  I approach everything with a growth mindset, I'm results-oriented (thanks, Army!), and I have a work-ethic that's difficult to match. I carefully analyze (and let's be honest, I sometimes over-analyze 😅) obstacles, and love collaborating and brainstorming with others, but I'm equally confident taking initiative and working independently (just give me some headphones 🎧). 

  When I don't have numbers swirling about my head, you can find me adventuring 🗺 with my partner, daughter, and two pups 👨‍👩‍👧🐕‍🦺🦮. I also love rugby 🏉, reading 📚, video games 🎮, and throwing down weights at the gym 🏋️‍♂️.
